 Original gamemode by [vdauphin](https://vdauphin.github.io/HeartsAndMinds/).

***Enhanced air support, player scaling, permissions, custom UI, dynamic economy, and more!*** 

## Overview üåê

<p align="justify">
HeartsAndMindsPlus (H&M+) is a customized Arma 3 gamemode by Tetlys, building upon the original work by <strong>vdauphin</strong>. Play as a modern day occupying army that is forced to secure 100+ key points accross the map while maintaining law & order throughout captured terriory. Help citizens, clear IEDs, talk to locals and search for enemy hideouts in order to build a "green zone" for safe passage of logistics and rear echelon activites. Your forces are never safe as enemy fighting patrols probe your ingress and exfil paths to FOBs. 

H&M+ has a role for everyone. Command, logistics, medical, infatry, armour and air are all combined in a typical mission. Each loss is felt. Whether it be a vehicle or a soldier. 

The gamemode works on a ticket system that keeps the server open to players. When the tickets get to zero. The server is locked and a cash penalty is paid to re-open the server.

As the USMC motto states. "No man left behind" and H&M+ demands the same. The deceased will need to be repatriated to the FOB for process. This grants tickets. Wounded enemy can be stablised and process for a larger ticket bonus.

Damaged and wrecked vehicles can also be recovered and repaired.

This makes recovery missions a large part of H&M+.
