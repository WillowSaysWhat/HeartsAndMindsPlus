## Salvage System

The Salvage System lets you recover damaged enemy vehicles and either tow them back to base using the towing system, or mount it on to a recovery truck. Once at base: 

* the enemy vehicle will need to be placed in proximity of the salvage bay.  
* the savage menu will need to be opened using ACE interact.
* And the vehicle sold by highlighting it and selecting `sell`.

## Role-Specific Arsenal

It's important to have a full range of weapons for an infantry squad, however, getting your team to actually use them can be difficult. That is why H&M+ utilises a restricted arsenal. Each role within a squad is present in the lobby and each slot-type has access to equipment necessary to fulfill that role. For example, an Autorifleman has access to different types of squad support weapons and machine guns. It does not have access to assault rifles. This ensures that a squad will have an autorifleman with a weapon that will create a force multipler and point suppression. 

However, this can be altered within the `rolearsenal.sqf` file located in `/Vanilla Files`.
