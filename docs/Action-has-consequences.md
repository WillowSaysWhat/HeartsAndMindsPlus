# Overview
<p align="justify">
Hearts & Minds+ is a gamemode based on player sentiment where positive actions will result in positive responses from the civilian population. Poor behaviour will result in retaliation. 

The "currency" for population sentiment and actions is visualised through **Reputation.** This was displayed at the top of the client, however a player can now ask a civilian for their reputation level through interaction. Below is the previous location of the repuation system.
